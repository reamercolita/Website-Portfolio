        When I was a child, I wanted to be a chef because I really loved cooking for others—that has always been my love language. But when I reached high school, I discovered that I also had a strong interest in Information Technology. I realized that as time goes on, technology continues to grow and expand, offering more opportunities and promising careers with competitive salaries. That’s why I decided to take BSIT in college. And guess what? I got into my dream university with my dream course!
